Be careful with editing files in the engine/ folder as they may affect gameplay and implementation of crucial base features.

Note: The controls.json file is not to be editted by the user, the controls file is only used when there is no existing binds
found for a user. Modifying controls is up to the developer themselves, either by a GUI implementation or just a simple
file implementation.
